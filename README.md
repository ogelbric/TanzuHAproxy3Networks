# Tanzu with HAproxy with 3 Networks

vCenter with Kubernetes and HAproxy can be set up with 2 network (default) and/or 3 networks (more production like).
This guide will focus on the 3 network set up. 

The over all steps are (provided the vCenter and ESXi(x3) hosts are up and running including shared storage) loading the HAproxy appliance 
into vCenter (https://github.com/haproxytech/vmware-haproxy/releases) and then enableling in vCenter the kubernetes option.
